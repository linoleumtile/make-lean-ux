Make Lean UX
============

Design and UX in enterprise environments can be an exercise in heartache and pain. Lean UX is a set of principles to help Design, UX, and Engineering work better together, so that improved results can be delivered to the business, and more importantly, to the user.

This talk is about harnessing the "Maker" spirit to enable Lean UX, specifically with front end development. I'll talk about strategies we developed at Best Buy in 2012, approaches other companies are taking, and evolutions of those strategies that I am applying today in the healthcare industry.
